      <h2>Background Information</h2>
      <p>
        Access to clean water and proper sanitation remains a major challenge in many communities. 
        Contaminated water sources, lack of latrines, and poor hygiene practices contribute to the 
        spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, and typhoid. Children and the elderly 
        are particularly vulnerable to these health risks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recognizing these challenges, the Sanitation and Clean Water Project was initiated to provide 
        sustainable solutions. The project focuses on improving water infrastructure, promoting hygiene 
        education, and empowering communities to maintain clean and safe water systems. By addressing 
        these critical needs, the project aims to improve health, reduce disease, and enhance overall 
        quality of life.
