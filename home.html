    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Our Sanitation and Clean Water project focuses on ensuring that every community has access
      to safe and reliable water sources. We believe that clean water and proper sanitation are
      basic human needs that support good health and sustainable development. Through awareness
      campaigns, construction of sanitation facilities, and community training, we strive to
      prevent diseases, protect the environment, and improve the overall quality of life for all
      people.
